### Artifacts
Changes made to increase rarity since many of the items are very overpowered.

- **Artifact Rarity**: 1 > 100
- **Campsite Count**: 4 > 1 (Generated too frequently)
- **Mimic chance**: 0.3 > 0.45 (To account for decreased campsite count)
- **Everlasting Beef Chance**: Now 1/10000 chance of dropping

### Create
- **Powered Train Top Speed**: 40 > 50
- **Powered Train Turning Speed**: 20 > 25

### Spelunkery
- **Creative Tab**: disabled > enabled
- 
### Hybrid Aquatic
- **Stopped Anglerfish spawning**: Replaced with it's terrifying cousin from Aquamirae

### Regions Unexplored
- **Reduced the biome weights down signfiicantly**: Allow vanilla biomes to spawn more frequently instead of getting overwhelmed with RU biomes
- **Removed some individual biomes**:
    - Bamboo Forest, Golden Boreal Taiga, Mauve Hills (All a bit boring)
    - Magnolia Woodland, Aumtumnl Maple Forest, Deciduous Forests, Magnolia Woodland, Silver Birch Forest, Willow Forest (Reduce the amount of forests, increase generation of swamps, desert biomes)
    - Redstone caves (Over powered)
    - Scorching caves (Too Dangerous)
    - Maple forest (Replaced with Natures Spirit alternative)
    - Alpha Grove. Grass textures conflict with structure datapack generation
- **Replaced various blocks with Natures Spirit alternatives**: Hibiscus Flower

### Natures Spirit
- **Disabled the following biomes**:
    - Cypress fields, Redwood Forest (Regions Unexplored has better looking biomes)
- **Disabled Joshua trees & wood type**: Conflict with Regions Unexplored

## The Graveyard
- **Removed some structure generation**: Medium Graveyard (To reduce the total number of Graveyard Structures), Lich Prison (Boss spawning is disabled)
- **Remove mob spawns entirely for the following mobs**: Ghouls, Revenant, Nightmare, Ghouling, Corrupted Champion (Bad models and(or) animations)
- **Removed some individual Blocks & Items**: Skeleton Hand, Bone Staff blocks & items (All my homies hate Mixels)
- **Disabled Horde Spawns**: Neat idea but to difficult for the average player
- **Give a spawn chance to the wraith**: Substitute for the lack of other mob spawns. Same spawning weight as the Reaper with a maximum group chance of 1

## Known Bugs

- Signs from the following mods when placed will display as oak signs: Regions Unexplored, Natures Spirit. This is a consequence of a debug mod implemented to stop in-correct wood type registries crashing the server. See: [Issue #16 for Natures Spirit](https://github.com/Team-Hibiscus/NatureSpirit/issues/16) for an explanation.
- Natures Spirit flowers can be too big causing a weird black box rendering issue
- Slight texture issue for pocket computers with the ccc resourcepack (Probably wont fix, too small)
